# Haya
A *just for fun* frontend website.

Haya was a fun project which I created in one day.

I wanted to create a front-end website after I wrote a lot of backend.
I thought a website for a js library would be nice so the texts are only BS and placeholders.

#### Haya consists out of 3 pages
* The homepage (index.html)
* The documentation
* The How-To-Use-It page

This is HTML and CSS only. I used Bootstrap for the layout and jQuery for front-end user experience.
